# Product: Chef

**Why this project exists:**
Chef was created to dramatically simplify and accelerate full-stack web development. It allows developers to build and iterate on applications using natural language prompts, reducing the time and complexity traditionally associated with building web apps from scratch.

**Problems it solves:**
- **Slow Development Cycles:** Traditional development requires writing extensive boilerplate code for backend, frontend, database, and authentication. Chef automates this process.
- **Complexity of Full-Stack:** Building a full-stack application requires expertise in multiple domains. Chef abstracts away much of this complexity.
- **Real-time Feature Implementation:** It simplifies the creation of real-time UIs and background workflows, which can be challenging to implement manually.

**How it should work:**
A developer provides a natural language prompt describing the application they want to build. Chef, as an AI agent, interprets the prompt and generates the necessary code for a complete full-stack application. This includes:
- A reactive database schema.
- Backend functions and business logic.
- A frontend UI built with Remix/React.
- User authentication.

**User experience goals:**
- **Seamless Generation:** The process of generating an app from a prompt should be smooth and intuitive.
- **Fast Iteration:** Developers should be able to quickly modify and extend the generated application with further prompts.
- **Developer-Friendly:** While AI-generated, the resulting code should be clean, understandable, and easy for a developer to take over and customize.
