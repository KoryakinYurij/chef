# Context

This file tracks the current state of the project and the ongoing work.

## Current Focus

The `analyze-dependencies` workflow has been completed, and the `research-findings.md` file has been added to the Memory Bank.

## Recent Changes

*   The Memory Bank has been updated with a new file: `research-findings.md`. This file contains a detailed analysis of the project's dependencies, common errors, and community-verified patterns.

## Next Steps

*   The Memory Bank is now up-to-date with the latest research findings. I am ready to assist with any new tasks.
