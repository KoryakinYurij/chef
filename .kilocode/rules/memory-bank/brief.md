# Project Brief

This is an AI Agent application called "Chef". It is a full-stack web application built with Remix for the frontend and Convex for the backend. The primary function of the application is to provide an interface for interacting with an AI assistant, which can perform various development tasks within a WebContainer environment.

The application allows users to chat with the AI agent, which can then edit files, install packages, deploy applications, and interact with the file system on their behalf. It includes features for managing API keys, tracking usage, sharing chat sessions, and providing a workbench environment with file editing and terminal capabilities.
