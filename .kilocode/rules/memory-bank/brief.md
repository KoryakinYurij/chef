# Chef Project Brief

**Objective:** Chef is an AI agent that builds full-stack web applications. It uses natural language prompts to generate code for both the frontend and backend, including a database, authentication, and other features.

**Key Features:**
- **AI-Powered Code Generation:** Utilizes AI models (like GPT, Claude, and Gemini) to write code.
- **Full-Stack Applications:** Generates complete applications with a frontend (Remix/React) and a backend (Convex).
- **Real-time Database:** Leverages Convex for a reactive database.
- **Authentication:** Includes built-in user authentication.

**Technologies:**
- **Backend:** Convex, Node.js
- **Frontend:** Remix, React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS
- **AI:** Integrates with multiple AI provider APIs.

**Significance:** Chef simplifies web development by allowing developers to create and iterate on applications using natural language, significantly speeding up the development process.
